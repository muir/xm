Move DefaultNamespase to Seed, make required

For enums from OTEL, generate them from the protobuf constants.

Use ZSON for main transport?  https://www.brimdata.io/blog/unmarshal-interface/

new EnumAttribute where each value also implies the key. 

Replace HexBytes with arrays etc can be used as map keys.  Use go 1.18?  HexBytes8, HexBytes16, HexByte ?
Hmmm, if entire trace is a bytes string, it can be treated as  StrAttribute...

Use generics to make type-safe Enum span attributes: can't do it as a method on Span, but can
do it as a function. 

Adhere to go spec: Id -> ID

Get rid of xop.Thing entirely.

Rename "xoplog" -> "xop"

Figure out a way to enforce limited vocabulary on select Attributes and Data elements


Metrics
	
	Re-use attribute naming?

	Allow "tags" or some other multi-dimensional naming

Events

	Gets counted

	Re-use attributes?

	Attach arbitrary data

Can chaining be done with generics?

	type bot interface{
		Int(string, int64)
		Bool(string, bool)
		New() bot
	}

	type top interface{

	type Builder[T:any, B:bot] struct {
		T
	}
	func (b Builder[T]) Int8(k string, v int8) Builder[T]
